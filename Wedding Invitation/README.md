#Wedding Invitation
The wedding ceremony (Bengali: বিবাহ or বিয়ে bibaho/biye) follows the Gaye Holud(lit., "turmeric is applied to the skin") ceremonies. The wedding ceremony is arranged by the bride's family. The groom, along with his friends and family (Borjatri), traditionally arrive later in the evening.
